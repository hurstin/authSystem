name: CI pipeline # The name of the workflow as it will appear in the GitHub Actions "Actions" tab

# Event triggers: Defines when this workflow should run
on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main"] # Trigger on push events targeting the main branch
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ] # Trigger on pull request events targeting the main branch

jobs:
  # Define a job named 'build-and-test'
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # The type of runner that the job will run on (latest Ubuntu version)

    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out the repository code so the workflow can access it
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up the Node.js environment
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20' # Specify the Node.js version to use
          cache: 'npm' # Cache npm dependencies to speed up future runs

      # Step 3: Install dependencies
      # 'npm ci' is preferred over 'npm install' for CI environments as it installs exactly what's in package-lock.json
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      # Step 4: Linting
      # Checks for code style and formatting issues based on the project's configuration (e.g., ESLint)
      - name: Run Lint
        run: npm run lint --if-present

      # Step 5: Build
      # Compiles the TypeScript code to JavaScript. This verification ensures the project is buildable and detects transpilation errors.
      - name: Build Project 
        run: npm run build --if-present

      # Step 6: Testing
      # Runs unit tests to ensure code correctness and prevent regressions.
      - name: Run Unit Tests
        run: npm run test --if-present
